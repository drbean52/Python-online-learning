Guessing Game 

Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9). Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right. (_Hint: remember to use the user input lessons from the very first exercise

Extras:
Keep the game going until the user types “exit”
Keep track of how many guesses the user has taken, and when the game ends, print this out.


import random
target=random.randint(1,9)
count=0
guess=0

while True:
    guess=int(input('Please guess a number between 1 and 9. '))
    count+=1
    
    if guess>target:
        print('You guessed too high.')
    elif guess<target:
        print('You guessed too low.')
    else:
        print('You guessed exactly right.')
        break
    
    if input('Do you want to guess again? If not, please type "exit". Otherwise type "yes" ')=='exit':
        break
    else:
        continue

print('You guessed '+str(count)+ ' times.')
