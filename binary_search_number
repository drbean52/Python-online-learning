This time, weâ€™re going to do exactly the opposite. You, the user, will have in your head a number between 0 and 100. The program will guess a number, and you, the user, will say whether it is too high, too low, or your number.
At the end of this exchange, your program should print out how many guesses it took to get your number.

# Official solution: 

import random
mylist=range(0,101)
midpoint=int(len(mylist)/2)
guess=mylist[midpoint]
count=1

while True:
    clue=input(str(guess)+ ', too high, too low or correct?' )
    
    if clue=='correct':
        print('I get it right, it is ' +str(guess))
        print('you have tried ' + str(count)+ ' times.')
        break
        
    if clue=='high':
        mylist=mylist[:midpoint]
    else:
        mylist=mylist[midpoint:]
    midpoint=int(len(mylist)/2)    
    guess=mylist[midpoint]
    count+=1
    
    
# My own, better soultion!   
    
import random

guess=random.randint(0,101)
count=1
top = 101
bottom=0

while True:
    print(guess)
    clue=input('Too high,too low or correct?' )

    if clue=='correct':
        print('I get it right, it is ' +str(guess))
        print('you have tried ' + str(count)+ ' times.')
        break
        
    if clue=='high':
        top=guess
    else:
        bottom=guess
    guess=range(bottom,top+1)[int((top-bottom)/2)]
    count+=1
